I had the pleasure of teaching and mentoring Briana McKee at Paul Mitchell the School Dallas from May 2010 to February 2011.

Academically, Briana excelled in all subjects. She was never content with vague answers, instead she explored and researched information until she fully embraced a topic or subject. She was extremely creative and remained knowledgeable of current trends and industry related studies and technology.

I still remember the day she toured Paul Mitchell the School Dallas, with a pen and notebook in hand. She was prepared with a list of questions and asked more specific questions than any other prospect Iâ€™ve ever met. I was immediately impressed by that and knew that she did her homework!

Briana was strongly self-driven. One of the things that stood out to me the most about her is that she always kept busy. She did what had to be done, whether it was cleaning or organizing without being asked to.

Briana often did more than was assigned to her and helped others complete their tasks as well. One time, she even brought a tool from home and volunteered to fix a loose screw on one of our facial machines!

Throughout the course of her program, she maintained Top Producer status for highest sales in services and take home of her entire class. She was also recognized for having the most total guests.

Briana also had a reputation of making her guests fall in love with her. She had the highest rebooking/request guests. Briana was constantly striving to improve herself or contributed to developmental strategies of improving various things within our school and program. She always remained a team player, hard working, creative, smart and an excellent communicator.

If given the opportunity, I would not hesitate to hire Briana and make her a part of my team. I believe if given the opportunity Briana McKee will be a strong asset to any company and an extraordinary leader.
