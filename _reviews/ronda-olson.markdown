Having had the privilege to travel and live all over the world, I have also been blessed to experience skin care from many different estheticians over two decades. Product lines and modern equipment make a big difference but the esthetician is without a doubt the critical component. The complexity of the skin and the issues that arise require a unique mix of knowledge, skill, and a desire to always keep learning with an open mind.

I found all three when I met Briana McKee!

When I met Briana in February of 2014, I was a few months into a significant physical detoxification and weight loss process. My skin was in need of an extra gentle touch and understanding. What I found in my very first session was a kind, compassionate and very knowledgeable skin care professional. She worked diligently with me to improve my skin issues and help me keep up my confidence as I went through this transition. Even when I had questions about doing esthetic procedures that her employer did not offer, her willingness to research the subject and walk me through her understanding was so generous. Best of all, her attention to detail from my brows to the cleanliness of her room and equipment is impeccable.

As a private business consultant I can attest that Briana has the unique combination of a passion for esthetics with the understanding of effective business promotion. This is one of the most difficult aspects I run into with small businesses. Clients do not magically walk through your door, you must cultivate them. I have literally witnessed her successful efforts to educate people young and old about the importance and benefits of skin care. All of this is with a smile on her face and a sincere attitude to help people. Any business would do well to have Briana McKee on their team!
